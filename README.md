# Final-Projecet
for the final project.

ARTG 

DUE 6/4 by 11:59PM

In your final project you will be making a game that focuses on one of the following three dimensions of how narrative can be forged into the design of our games:

You must choose at least one of these Narrative Dimensions to work with in your design:

Linear Narrative:
You will make a plot-based narrative game where players trigger a series of events that tell a story based on your theme.

Embedded Narrative / Emergent Narrative:
Game mechanics designed around the uncovering of interactions that create opportunity to interpret, infer or generate story within the play of the game.

Evocative Spaces / Narrative Frames:
The essence of a narrative world, story, or setting is hinted at through the atmospheric dimensions of the game.
This could involve the visual, sonic, mechanics, or even the flavorful design of physical game instruments themselves.

FORM
Your final assignment for this class may take the form of:
-card game: cards + any other materials needed to play
-board game: board + box + all materials needed to play
-ttrpg: rule-text in zine or book form + any other materials needed to play
-digital game: must be uploaded onto itch.io

All projects, regardless of form will be presented,
-in their final, playable and aesthetically resolved forms,
-as a demonstration or pitch in the 10th week of class.
Physical Games: game components will be presented physically to the class along with a 3 slide PDF that addresses the concept, the design goals, and how the original prompt was addressed in the final form.
Digital Games: Will be uploaded to itch.io, and demonstrated for your presentation/pitch in front of class while you present. Key frames will be submitted as a PDF for grading purposes.

THEMES:
Each group can either choose one of the following themes or the *Choose Your Own option.

1. Liminality:
Definition: occupying a position at, or on both sides of, a boundary or threshold.
If you choose this option, your group should think about how to evoke a feeling of liminality within the game feel and aspect of narrative dimension chosen above.

2. Uncanny Mutation:
Definition: a change in form or nature from an original to a new and different state; one that evokes strange, mysterious, or unsettling feelings
If you choose this option, your group should think about how mutation can act as a gateway to uncanny experience, and how you can capture this in the feel of your game and intertwine it with the game feel and narrative dimension chosen above.

3. Myth:
Definition: a collection of fundamental stories, especially ones with a particular cultural affiliation.
If you choose this option, your group should decide on a particular existing myth you want to interpret into game form.

OR

Choose Your Own: 
If you choose your own theme, your team needs to collectively define it, distill it into one, or at most, two words, and then write a statement about why you believe this is an important theme for a game to explore.
This statement will be due along with your Codes of Conduct and Concept assignment as a part of your first Design Journal Entry.

Your statement must include:
Title: (Theme): At most a two-word distillation of your theme's title. It must be an abstract noun, not a concrete noun. And you may use a single adjective as a modifier for it for your second word (ie. Uncanny Mutation)
(here is an article you can use for reference on the meaning of abstract noun: https://www.grammarly.com/blog/abstract-nouns/Links to an external site.)
Meaning: Imagine you are writing a passage for a dictionary on your theme's meaning. Please write out a definition of your theme.
Values: The values of your design team and how they align with this theme.
Design Goals: What type of experience you are hoping to generate for a player that makes this particular theme unique or important as a means to execute that feel.

Theme
Nearby in space,
but distant in time.


Integration:
- Narrative or visual art (~time travel story)
- Mechanics (~time travel puzzles)
- Technical implementation (~geolocation/clock)
- Audience (~relates to a deep memory of someone close to you)

Core Requirements
1. Smooth experience of full-screen play in a mobile browser.
2. User is capable of learning to play from within the game (not consulting outside instructions).
3. User is capable of toggling background music from within the game, and this preference is saved across sessions.
4. Core gameplay can be reached within 1 minute, and an experienced player can complete the experience within 10 minutes (3-5 preferred).

Example Core Gameplay requirements
Audio: 2+ kinds (looping background sound versus triggered event sounds)
Visual: 2+ kinds (sprite/sheet/atlas versus Graphics/mesh/video/tilemap/etc.)
Motion: Used as part of a core mechanic, either based on either kinematic (tweens) or dynamic (physics) movement.
Progression: There is some kind of progression across instances of core gameplay (e.g. narrative/difficulty/aesthetics).
Prefabs: 2+ techniques used in your code (GameObject subclasses, Scene subclasses, presets in code, or presets in external data file)

Example Scene Flow requirements
Includes at least main title and credits scenes, along with at least two more kinds of gameplay and/or menu scenes.
Some data must be communicated between scenes (how you perform in one scene impacts what is possible in another).
All narrative endings or levels in progression are reachable within the scene flow prototype.
Prototype demonstrates at least one kind of fancy transition between scenes.

Example Cinematic requirements
The main title / menu screen must appear and disappear using animations and use animations to present a feeling of liveness even when the user is not interacting with it.
Prototype includes one or more of: splash screen (before the title screen), introduction (start of story after title screen), ending (end of story), etc.
Must use a tween chain, timeline, or equivalent container for multiple animations.
